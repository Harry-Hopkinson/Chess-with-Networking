# Contributing to VS Code

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Python Networking!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Open an Issue.

I will assist you and fix the code.

## Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome, and the development team is available via a handful of different channels.

See the [Feedback Channels](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Feedback-Channels) wiki page for details on how to share your thoughts.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in VS Code? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Identify Where to Report

The VS Code project is distributed across multiple repositories. Try to file the issue against the correct repository. Check the list of [Related Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) if you aren't sure which repo is correct.

Can you recreate the issue even after [disabling all extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_disable-an-extension)? If you find the issue is caused by an extension you have installed, please file an issue on the extension's repo directly.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

* [ ] Recreate the issue after disabling all extensions

* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!

### Follow Your Issue

Once submitted, I will recieve your report. I will try to answer as quickly as possible but if I am not avaliable, I may take a while for an answer.

## Contributing Fixes

If you are interested in writing code to fix issues, fork the project and open a pull request. I will review the code and authorise it into the code.

# Thank You!
